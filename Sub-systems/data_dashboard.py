#using pyqt5 on jetson try and install this with it's drivers


# There are several GUI toolkits available in Python such as PyQt, Tkinter, wxPython, etc. You can choose the one that you are most familiar with or that best suits your needs.

# Install the required libraries: Depending on the toolkit you choose, you may need to install additional libraries. For example, if you choose PyQt, you will need to install PyQt5 library. You can install these libraries using pip or your package manager.

# Design the layout of the dashboard: Once you have chosen the GUI toolkit and installed the necessary libraries, you can start designing the layout of the dashboard. You can use tools like Qt Designer to create the layout of the dashboard and save it as a .ui file.

# Convert the .ui file to Python code: You can use the pyuic5 tool to convert the .ui file to Python code. This code will contain the definition of the UI widgets and their properties.

# Write the code for the dashboard: Using the generated Python code, you can add the logic to the dashboard. For example, you can add functionality to update the speedometer or fuel gauge based on the car's data.

# Test the dashboard: You can run the Python script and test the dashboard in your Linux environment.

# Here is a sample code snippet that demonstrates how to create a basic car dashboard using PyQt:

# python

import Jetson.GPIO as GPIO
import sys
from PyQt5.QtWidgets import QApplication, QMainWindow
from PyQt5.uic import loadUi

class Dashboard(QMainWindow):
    def __init__(self):
        super(Dashboard, self).__init__()
        loadUi('dashboard.ui', self)
        self.show()

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app = QApplication(sys.argv)
    dashboard = Dashboard()
    sys.exit(app.exec_())



# Set up GPIO pins for the Jetson's speed sensor
GPIO.setmode(GPIO.BOARD)
GPIO.setup(12, GPIO.IN)

# Loop to continuously read the speed sensor and display speed on the dashboard
while True:
    speed = GPIO.input(12)
    # Display the speed on the dashboard
